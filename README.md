# Coding-a-Discord-Chat-Bot-That-Talks-Like-Your-Favorite-Character
Use AI to create a Discord chat bot that talks like your favorite characters
The following procedure is an example for the Rachel Green bot:
1. Add the Chandler Bing Script.txt and parse_script_chandler.ipynb to your google drive and convert the txt into a csv file
2. Upload model_train_rachel_model.ipynb to your google drive and open with google colab and run the code
3. Create a hummingbird account to deploy your model -->  https://huggingface.co/models
4. Use repl.it to host the bot and use the code present in the zip file :RachelBotJS.zip   --> https://replit.com/repls
5. Use uptime robot to use the bot indefinitely --> https://uptimerobot.com/

(The no. of epochs of tony stark’s model has been set to 4 and I’ve used dialoGPT-small whereas
The no. of epochs of chandler’s  and rachel’s models  has been set to 10 (when doing this set the batch size to 2!) and I’ve used dialoGPT-medium so these
chat bots are much better that tony stark’s chat bot in this case.)
